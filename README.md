# social-network-api

## Description
This is an API for a social network application where users can share their thouughts, create a friend list, and react to friends' thought.

## Installation
Users will need to install dependences in the terminal using `npm i` and then start the app with `node server.js`

## Usage
Since this is just the backend of an app, users will need a client-side API like Insomnia to interact. From there, you can make CRUD requests. Here is a [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C-bTi-vBkFKD78hIEwIpiccTaGiLJ1OF/view)
